	abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is not new in neuroimaging, and it became evident years ago with the proliferation of publicly available neuroimaging datasets. To solve this critical issue, the neuroimaging community created the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) that specifies standards for how datasets should be organized to facilitate sharing and reproducibility of science. Currently, BIDS supports dozens of neuroimaging modalities including MRI, EEG, MEG, PET, and many others. In this paper, we present the extension of BIDS for NIRS data alongside tools that may assist researchers in organizing existing and new data with the goal of promoting public disseminations of fNIRS datasets.},

As of today, standardizing datasets requires technical expertise such as coding and knowledge of file formats. We present ezBIDS, a tool for converting neuroimaging data and associated metadata to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard. ezBIDS contains four major features: (1) No installation or programming requirements. (2) Handling of both imaging and task events data and metadata. (3) Semi-automated inference and guidance for adherence to BIDS. (4) Multiple data management options: download BIDS data to local system, or transfer to OpenNeuro.org or to brainlife.io. In sum, ezBIDS requires neither coding proficiency nor knowledge of BIDS, and is the first BIDS tool to offer guided standardization, support for task events conversion, and interoperability with OpenNeuro.org and brainlife.io.},

Traditionally, BIDS had a strong focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets and lacked guidance on how to store multimodal structural MRI datasets. Here, we present and describe the BIDS Extension Proposal 001 (BEP001), which adds a range of quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications to the BIDS. In general, the aim of qMRI is to characterize brain microstructure by quantifying the physical MR parameters of the tissue via computational, biophysical models. By proposing this new standard, we envision standardization of qMRI through multicenter dissemination of interoperable datasets. This way, BIDS can act as a catalyst of convergence between qMRI methods development and application-driven neuroimaging studies that can help develop quantitative biomarkers for neural tissue characterization. In conclusion, this BIDS extension offers a common ground for developers to exchange novel imaging data and tools, reducing the entrance barrier for qMRI in the field of neuroimaging.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

We demonstrate NWB’s impact through unified description of neurophysiology data across diverse modalities and species. NWB exists in an ecosystem, which includes data management, analysis, visualization, and archive tools. Thus, the NWB data language enables reproduction, interchange, and reuse of diverse neurophysiology data.

In order to be as lightweight a dependency as possible, Neo is deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualization. Neo implements a hierarchical data model well adapted to intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology and EEG data with support for multi-electrodes (for example tetrodes) and image sequences. To take into account the heterogeneity of scenarios under which data are acquired in experiment and simulation, Neo features a flexible representation of structured relationships between individual data objects and supports the annotation of data objects with arbitrary metadata as key-value pairs. In Python, Neo's data objects include robust handling of physical units (via the quantities package), including unit conversions. They can be used as NumPy arrays from a user perspective to simplify their use and integration in existing code.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists use many different software tools to acquire, analyse and visualise electrophysiological signals. 
However, incompatible data models and file formats make it difficult to exchange data between these tools. 
This reduces scientific productivity, renders potentially useful analysis methods inaccessible and impedes collaboration between labs.
A common representation of the core data would improve interoperability and facilitate data-sharing.
To that end, we propose here a language-independent object model, named "Neo", suitable for representing data acquired from electroencephalographic, intracellular, or extracellular recordings, or generated from simulations. 
As a concrete instantiation of this object model we have developed an open source implementation in the Python programming language.
In addition to representing electrophysiology data in memory for the purposes of analysis and visualisation, the Python implementation provides a set of input/output (IO) modules for reading/writing the data from/to a variety of commonly used file formats.
Support is included for formats produced by most of the major manufacturers of electrophysiology recording equipment and also for more generic formats such as MATLAB.
Data representation and data analysis are conceptually separate: it is easier to write robust analysis code if it is focused on analysis and relies on an underlying package to handle data representation.
For that reason, and also to be as lightweight as possible, the Neo object model and the associated Python package are deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualisation.
Software for neurophysiology data analysis and visualisation built on top of Neo automatically gains the benefits of interoperability, easier data sharing and automatic format conversion; there is already a burgeoning ecosystem of such tools. 
We intend that Neo should become the standard basis for Python tools in neurophysiology.},
